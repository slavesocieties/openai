Individuals whose baptisms are recorded in these documents are designated as either negro/a, mulato/a, moreno/a, pardo/a, indio/a, or mestizo/a.  These records were originally bound in a volume entitled, \"libro segundo de baptismos de negros y mulatos...\"  In the twentieth century, these baptismal records were re-bound and given the title, \"Book of Baptism of Colored People 1793-1807.\"  The records range from 21 October 1793 to 12 May 1807, contain 818 entries, and comprise pages 1-354.   At a minimum, each entry records the date of baptism; the individual's date of birth or age at baptism; whether s/he is free or enslaved (and if enslaved, the owner's name); if the parents are known, then their names, racial designation or skin color, and whether enslaved or free; name of godparent; the name and title of the priest who performed the baptism;  individual's nationality or place of previous residency.
